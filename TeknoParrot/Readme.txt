Changes in TeknoParrot 1.0.0.122 Release:
*STATEMENT BY REAVER*
Full open source is closing in on us. The more contributions and support we get from community developers, the more we will open source.

Do you understand the magnitude of what we can do with the ElfLoader?
Basically run ANY/ALL linux games on Windows like Wine does for Linux.
Especially now that our elfloader can emulate even libs(.so)!

The following months will tell us what will happen, if support is great and community is friendly. All source code will go public.



Special thanks to Nezarn, Boomslangnz, sTo0z, nibs and nzgamer41 for working on stuff tirelessly with me and keeping me motivated despite all the hate.

And remember, none of the Patreon funds come to me for personal use.
All of the money goes to developers and hardware to get more work done.

Changes in TeknoParrot 1.05 Public Build:
- ID6 Pair Play! Read 1.04a notes for instructions.
- Easier mode for loaders with Ultimate ASI Loader! (https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases)
How to use: 
* Instead of using ParrotLoader, you can now drag and drop "Extra_For_Loaders" content to game dir.
NOTE: Copy winmmbase.dll only with ID6 as it's needed for cards, other games are fine with dinput8.dll alone!
* Note that this does not work yet for Mouse games but will be fixed soon!

* After this run the game exe directly, even the card reader picodaemon.exe will work!

      Just remember to use their IP addresses and gateway etc. not your local!
NOTE: DO NOT USE IDLOGGER OR NETWORK DOES NOT WORK!!!! Hopefully this will be fixed soon in idlogger.
<---------------How-to---------------------->
1. Go to TEST MENU, set cabinets ID to A1 and other A2.
2. If you want to use cards you can do that, remember to enable card readers and start picodaemon!
3. Once your settings are saved and each player has separate id you need to edit config.ini
<------------------------------------------->
Cab1IP is A1 cabinets IP.
Cab2IP is A2 cabinets IP.
BroadcastIP is the connections broadcast ip.
Windowed mode also now enable for NVIDIA users, so the minimap doesn't break.
