2014/12/24
 * HyperLaunch (updated to v3.1.0.0 BETA):
  - Add support for different screen orientations for vertical games, rotating monitors and cocktail cabs. HyperPause, fade, instruction cards, password, multigame and rom mapping launch menu works on 0º, 90º, 180º and 270º.
  - HyperLaunchLog shows a warning when User Functions.ahk or User Functions Init.ahk are missing.
  - i18n localization support: Non-English users now have certain parts of the modules converted automatically in memory to their language. For example "Open" converts to "Abrir" if you use a Portuguese Windows.
  - New file that provides the translation mapping: HyperLaunch\Data\Language\Localization.ini
  - HyperLaunch now supports launching the MultiGame feature on launch. This gives you the ability to only have one disc for example, in your database and give a disc selection instead. You must have MG enabled, and also the new setting MultiGame_On_Launch.
  - HyperLaunch will error if you set your keymapper to something other than xpadder or joytokey (like if it's blank)
  - Log now states if the User Functions.ahk is not found
  - Fixed a bug that HL would think a rom was picked from rom mapping when it wasn't
  - Fixed a bug when Fade was enabled but Statistics was not, would cause a missing function error.
  - Fixed a couple RomTableCheck scenarios that would stall HL when it shouldn't be.
  - 7z will no longer try to determine if you have enough free space on a network drive to extract to as this number is not visible to windows.
  - 7z now creates the 7zExtractPath if it does not exist already and reports correctly when the drive does not exist or it couldn't write to that drive.
  - When debug or greater logging is enabled, the extraction progress of 7z gets dumped to the log.
  - ExitModule now declares when it has started to prevent other functions from starting during the exit routine when they shouldn't be.
  - The default font is now automatically installed if it was not installed already. This will also install any fonts residing in the HL Media's Font folder too if they are used.
  - PCLauncher uses its own HideCursor setting, so when using this module and you want to control the mouse visibility, it must be set in PCLauncher module settings. The normal HL setting will not apply.
  - CreateRomTable will no longer be created on exit. This should speed up exiting in some scenarios when it was unnecessarily being created.
  - Fixed a bug when using the Rom Map menu and a valid extension was not found from your defined extensions.
  - Player Select Menu GUI now can be called from any module
  - HyperLaunch now accepts a system xml when a default (Hyperspin Main Menu.xml) is not found. File should be located in .\Data\Databases\Systems.xml. For convenience, it should be the same format as the Hyperspin Main Menu.xml
  - When a Hyperspin Main Menu.xml nor a HyperLaunch Systems.xml can be found and direct launching the HyperLaunch.exe, the system selection drop down list is replaced with an edit box where user can type in a system name manually.
  - HideEmu now logs each unique window it finds and hides as a debug log entry.
  - HideEmu now hides emus on exit when enabled.
  - Replaced all Includes with FileReads. This should eliminate the bug where ahk would randomly try to include a file with the wrong path. No performance hit in this change.
  - Only files are allowed by default when a CheckFile() is called.
  - HyperLaunch now skips checking for romPaths and a romExtension if a fullpath to your rom was supplied via CLI. This can speed up launching slightly, especially if you have a lot of paths and extensions defined in HLHQ. Some FEs support this.
  - HyperLaunch now errors if the rom name contains the characters [ or ]
  - Version info for libraries are now reported to the log when troubleshooting mode is enabled.
  - New protection in place to prevent users from setting their 7zExtractTemp anywhere inside (above) their romPath. This would cause someone to delete their rom folder.
  - New Function - OpenROM - standardizes and replaces the old loop method used to interact with an emulators "Open" rom window. Module authors can call this method instead of recreating the lengthy and confusing loop method.
  - New Function - SetKeyDelay - standardizes and logs the use of SetKeyDelay and also allows HL to keep track of the current pressDelay in effect.
  - New Function - SendCommand - TBA
  - New Function - SplitPath - Supports UNC/SMB paths and multiple periods in the filename.
  - New Function - GetHLMediaFiles - Standardizes and logs gathering of all the media files HL uses.
  - New Function - Steam - Steam was removed from PCLauncher and made into its own function and able to be called from any module
  - New Function - Origin - Origin was removed from PCLauncher and made into its own function and able to be called from any module
  - New Function - DxwndIniRW/DxwndRun/DxwndClose - DXWnd can now be called from any module as it is considered an extension and has been provided its own set of functions to control it.
  - New Function - Rotate - Allows global support for rotating your screen on any module that calls it.
  - New Feature - HyperLaunch now has a Debug Console to show the log in real-time!
  - New Feature - HyperLaunch will validate cue and gdi files when using Daemon Tools support. It will also not allow mounting of images with mp3 audio tracks as DT does not support these.
  - New Feature - HyperLaunch now accepts proper CLI switches and in any order to better support other FEs simultaneously and multiple methods of launching. -s <System_Name>, -r <Database_Name>, -m <HL_Mode>, -p <Plugin>, -f <FE_Path>
  - New Feature - HyperLaunch now accepts a new CLI switch "-e", which will force a game to load via the sent mapped Emulator name or full path to a Emulator you want to load. Usage -e <Emulator_Name> or -e "<Emulator_Full_Path>"
  - New Feature - HyperLaunch now accepts a new CLI switch "-d", which will force a game to load via the sent mapped Module name or full path to a module you want to load. Usage -d <Module_Name> or -d "<Module_Full_Path>"
  - New Feature - Custom cursors can now be loaded by placing a cursor file into your HL Media Cursor folder. (ex. HyperLaunch\Media\Cursors\Nintendo DS\_Default\stylusred.cur)
  - New Feature - Lock Launch - Can be applied globally, per system, or per game.
  - Standard (true) lock - Prevent games from launching that you want to keep in your database but do not want to remove. Will simply return to your FE if you launch one of these.
  - Password lock - Need to input a password to launch. Password is any combination of directional keys (your HyperLaunch Navigation keys) up to 15 keys in length.
  - DirectOnly - Prevented from being launched normally, but can launch HP, MG, or Fade normally to view those features without actually launching the game.
 * HyperPause (updated to v1.0.6):
  - Fix to bug avoiding multigame to use hyperlaunch artwork located at HyperLaunch\Multigame\systemname\gamename folder.
  - Support for media\_Default folders on videos, artwork, controllers, guides and manuals (requested by potts43).

  - Changed screenshot function. (thks horseyhorsey, http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/sh...en-grabs/page3).
  - Added support for saving screenshot as BMP,DIB,RLE,JPG,JPEG,JPE,JFIF,GIF,TIF,TIFF and PNG (the default now is jpg because the smaller footprint) (If saving as jpg (JPG,JPEG,JPE,JFIF) then quality can be 1-100 with default at maximum quality). Controlled by the hyperpause ini keys: Screenshot_Extension and Screenshot_JPG_Quality (these should be moved to HyperLaunch ini files on a final release).
  - Improved code to make sure that bezel is restored well after HyperPause exit. (thks horseyhorsey, http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/sh...-after-HP-exit).
  - Added support for creating a color behind the HyperPause background, for filling the screen if a background image is smaller than the screen resolution. (requested by wiggles http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/sh...kground-images). (controled by hyperpause ini key Background_Color on ini section: [Main Menu Appearance Options].
  - Fix to statistics game names overlap.
  - Updated. If no HyperSpin game video is found, HyperPause will look for its parent video (http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?34389-HyperPause-Videos)
  - Updated. Changed HyperPause mute when start code to only mute the sound coming from the emulator (only supported at Windows Vista and above, on XP the master sound will be muted instead).
  - Updated. Added font exist check.

  - 1page - Displays 1 page at a time (what we have now)
  - 2pages - Displays 2 page at a time horizontally
  - coverup - Same as 2pages, but the first page will be displayed as a single page
  - frompdf - Reads page layout info from the actual PDF file and follows that setting
  - Changed the temp hyperpause folders to include the systemName (requested by brolly).
  - Added: while loading a new pdf page that is not yet converted, the previous page will remain in the screen and a centered text message will say "Loading New Page" while the page is being loaded (requested by brolly).
 * Fade (updated to v1.0.5):
  - Added support for Zero Dreams fade animation. Make sure that you have the required files on your media folder, and just load the hyperlaunchhq fade profile named "Zero Dreams fade.ini" to use this fade screen instead of the default one. To reload the default one you just need to load the profile named "Default fade.ini".
  - Added support for showing extraction remaining and elapsed time on fade screen (Requested by Sir Cyrano: http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?33512-Progress-Bar-With-Timer&highlight=remaining)
  - Added support for producing the efects introduced by Unknown50862 on the fade loading screen automatically for any system.

  - A few improvements to avoid running code without need to speed up a little things.
  - Fixed bug with instruction card scrolling text showing after exiting instruction card menu.
  - Changed the IC menu scale factor to be calculated from the height of the screen because it made more sense than using the screen width.
  - Added option to start game with ICs showing, randomly or not. Requested by mmg1design ( the instruction cards maker ) (http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?29509-Instruction-Card-with-Cheats-Info-Display-question)
  - Added option to enable ICs random Slide Show. The default value is 0 (=disable). You can change it for the amount of milliseconds that you between ICs changes. If you press any of the IC change keys the slide sho will stop. Requested by mmg1design. (http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?29509-Instruction-Card-with-Cheats-Info-Display-question)
  - Added support for defining ICs scalling through file name.
  - Added support for new file name convention
  - Updated. Background and overlay files named equal and at the same folder of the currrent selected bezel have priority to be showed. Requested by rfancella.
  - Updated. Added support for saving bezel selected (if true, everytime that you open a game the last choosen bezel will be loaded at beginning)
  - Updated. Added support for saving ICs selected (if true, everytime that you open a game the last choosen ICs will be showed). You should combine it with enabling the "display on startup" option to take advantage of it.
  - Updated. Added support for option Extra_FullScreen_Bezel. If true, it creates automatically a transparent bezel that fills the entire screen. This is useful to simulate a full screen windowed game. (this is very emulator dependable, and it will work better with emus that support normal bezel mode).
  - Updated. Added support on clone games for looking for bezel and ICs on parent folders.
  - NEW - added the possibility to use the background images on the HyperLaunch\Bckgrounds folder as bezel background. Controlled by the bezel ini key named: Use_Backgrounds, default = false (Allows use of media placed in the Backgrounds folder for Bezel backgrounds.).
  - NEW - Bezel now supports more image files: png, gif, tif, bmp and jpg (before it would only support png files). New ini key: Bezel_Supported_Image_Files, limits the image extensions that should be searched on the bezel code.
  - NEW - Added a if statement on the beginning of all bezel functions for checking if bezelEnabled = "true". This will allow to change at any time before the bezelDraw function call the bezel state at a game basis. In the future this could be handled either directly by hyperlaunch or through a module code settings (in order to work on a module, it requires that the bezel is enabled on HLHQ, because the bezel files will be only included on hyperlaunch on that case.
  - NEW - Added support for using plugin defined feMedia background assets.
  - NEW - Added setting to enable/disable IC cards from being used, even if they exist. Default is disabled. So for those who use ICs, be sure to enable this option globally or for just those systems you want to use them on.

2014/06/01
 * HyperLaunch (updated to v3.0.1.0):
  - Added - Checks for some required dll files.
  - Fixed - Some languages still reporting letter codes, rather than actual language in log.
  - Fixed - When Direct launching HyperLaunch.exe, the system selection would not parse out some system names correctly from the main menu.xml and in certain scenarios allowed extra text to sneak in.
  - Fixed - Missing HyperLaunch.ini were not being written to the file.
  - Fixed - Moved ToggleCursor label to the module thread as it didn't seem to work in the HL thread. You can now toggle your cursor again with your toggleCursorKey if you have it set. This also now is an xHotkey key and can be configured multiple methods like all the rest (needs an HLHQ update to support this change)
  - Changed - romPath is always sent to module now even if no rom is found and skipchecks is enabled.
  - Changed - Hiding of mouse cursor is now done entirely in the module thread. The method used to hide a cursor is not practical to have both threads control its visibility due to many static variables to keep track of when it's hidden and when not. When HideCursor is enabled, the initial hidden state now gets triggered in StartModule() instead of right before the module is built. Tests show this made no visible difference on launch.
  - Changed - Zinc as a System Name has changed and NO LONGER SUPPORTS NUMBERED ROMS IN THE XML. Yes you heard that right. The module now maps the correct short rom names in the updated xml to the numbers which zinc needs to launch each game. This means for anyone running zinc now, they need to get the new xml and module and change all their media to match the updated rom names in the xml.
 * Bezel.ahk
  - Added - Support for bezel key change (thanks to Manson and Thooperman for the help and ideas)
  - Added - [COLOR="#FF0000"]Full support for Instruction Cards (thanks to Manson and Thooperman for the help and ideas)[/COLOR]. See attached image to see it in action
  - Fixed - GUI drawing problems with fade in and fade out (thanks Noshgar for the help)	
 * HyperPause.ahk
  - Added - New HyperPause menu to show contents of history.dat. If you have HyperLaunch already installed you will need to change in the Hyperlaunch\Settings\Global HyperPause.ini files, in the section [Main Menu Appearance Options], this key value: Main_Menu_Items=Controller|Change Disc|Save State|Load State|HighScore|Artwork|Guides|Manuals|Videos|Sound|Statistics|Moves List|History|Shutdown (requested by jkonami - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=252228&viewfull=1#post252228[/url])
  - Fixed - HyperPause Moves List Incorrect Icon Names. Don't forget to update the "HyperLaunch Update Media and data files.zip" contents to your hyperlaunch media folder. (tahnsk brandsizzle - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27345-HyperPause-Moves-List-Incorrect-Icon-Names[/url])

  - Changed - Default screenshot saved to png file instead of bmp files (requested by horseyhorsey - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27301-Some-questions-about-saves-amp-their-screen-grabs&p=260296&viewfull=1#post260296[/url])
  - Added - Support for call to save and load state scripts from HyperPause menus. If the emulator module have the labels SaveSateSlot1, SaveSateSlot2,.. and LoadSateSlot1, LoadSateSlot2,... HyperPause will call these labels whenever you choose the save or load state buttons instead of trying to use the key send commands defined on the emulators.ini files. (requested by horseyhorsey - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27301-Some-questions-about-saves-amp-their-screen-grabs&p=260296&viewfull=1#post260296[/url])

  - Added - Option to set HyperPause own independent resolution. This is not recommended, use it at your own risk. Default is set to not change current resolution. You must provide a monitor compatible resolution in the format width|height|colors|frequency (for example: 1280|1024|32|60 for 1280x1024 pixels with 32 bit colors and 60Hz frequency). (requested by Hi! and alexd74 - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=258661&viewfull=1#post258661[/url] and [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=262490&viewfull=1#post262490[/url])
  - Changed - Default context font value to be a fixed width font in order to avoid any misalignment on txt guides. If you have HyperLaunch already installed you will need to change in the HLHQ the Content Text Font at Hyperpause -> Appearance 2 tab to Lucida Console. If you don't change that, it is possible that some contents of the guides txt files would be cropped when useing the Arial font instead. (requested by LapRocket and Brolly - fixed by wiggles - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27589-Hyperpause-txt-docs-for-guides-question[/url])
  - Fixed - Multigame issues on HyperPause (requested by brolly and djvj).
  - Fixed - HyperPause gamepad control bugs. (requested by lank.g01 and urbangangsta101 - fixed by windowlicker11 - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?27394-Weird-glitches-with-Hyperpause-and-xpadder-profiles[/url])
  - Added - Changes to support the new bezel features.
  - Added - Progress bar support for multigame changes that requires 7z extraction.
  - Added - Support for selecting a control profile different from the default loaded from all available profiles on your folders. You just need to go to the controller banner and press left (or right) to show a list of possible profiles. Pressing select you will choose the profile that you want to be loaded on the hyperpause exit. Many Thanks to ghutch for the implementation of necessary changes both on keymapper.ahk and hyperpause.ahk files. Keymapper must be enabled in order to access the controller config menu. (requested by bob.records - added by ghutch - [url]http://www.hyperspin-fe.com/forum/showthread.php?26074-HyperPause-Feature-Requests&p=258975&viewfull=1#post258975[/url])
 * Shared.ahk
  - Added - Changes to support the new bezel features.
  - Added - Another scenario with rom mapping when 7z is enabled, and there is no valid rom names or extensions, so you have skipchecks enabled. Previously this would error out in 7z, but now it gets through. The scenario for this would be when you wanted to use alternate archived names for an arcade or scummvm game, where the archive contains no roms or extensions that match the name in your db.
  - Added - 7z extractions now check for free space before performing an extraction. Will error out if you run out of space in your 7zExtractPath. This prevents a 7z.exe error that you might of not known the cause.
  - Added - IniReadCheck in the module thread now accepts multiple sections separated by |. The function will read each section in the ini and treat each consecutive section checked as the preferred value if it exists. Most commonly used to allow Global/system/rom or Global/rom module settings by only needing one function call in the module.
  - Fixed - Log in Shared.ahk StartModule() not showing correct romName.
  - Fixed - Log in Shared.ahk CreateRomTable() not showing "*."
  - Fixed - When 7z is enabled, yet wasn't needed because rom was either not compressed or already extracted in temp folder, you would get an ahk error about your animation label not found.
  - Fixed - When logging command windows, because all applications ran are logged, this would cause an issue with logs already being used. Now command logs are sequential. You may notice multiple command logs in your HL root folder if this is enabled.
  - Fixed - When showing command windows and multiples were open, HL would only close the first one. I now keep track of all of them and close each one on exit.
  - Changed - Module settings in log now include section name.
  - Changed - Rewrote how Fade finds it's Layer 1 and 2 images, shrinking code down by about 50%.
  - Changed - GetFadePicPosition() moved from Fade.ahk to Shared.ahk so the MFME module can use it when Fade is disabled.
  - Changed - Closing the module thread on ScriptError's now calls ExitModule() instead of ExitApp which has a very small chance to cause multiple errors if you have multiple problems, but no need to duplicate code to clean up on errors. Before, it would close after the first error and that's it. Now it will cleanly exit and restore proper keymaps if enabled.
  - Changed - Cancelling a 7z extraction now closes the module thread through ExitModule() instead of ExitApp. This should help prevent any issues with things lingering around after a cancel.
 * XHotkey.ahk
  - Fixed - Bug with hold key option.
 * Multigame.ahk
  - Changed - MultiGame now behaves exactly like HyperPause menus drawing.
  - Changed - Complete rewrite of how MultiGame finds Game Art, removing all duplicate code. In order to properly log everything, this was required. This will also speed up MG launch by a few ms, as less I/O checks are taking place.
  - Changed - AHK remaps are now independent from the other keymappers (xpadder and joytokey) and can be used on its own or in conjunction with the others. This means you can now use AHK and xpadder if you wish. See the new key Keymapper_AHK_Enabled. (needs an HLHQ update to configure this new option)
  - Added - Changes to support the new bezel features.
  - Added - Automatic resize multigame options for different resolutions. Set the image adjust scale to "0" (zero), and all multigame components will be resized to your current screen resolution assuming that the original values were made for a 1920x1080 resolution.
  - Added - Progress bar support for multigame changes that requires 7z extraction. This means that when you swap discs, and 7z is used for extraction, you will now see a progress bar.
  - Added - MultiGame now logs everywhere it's looking and the images it finds that will be used.
  - Fixed - One path where MultiGame scans for Game Art images was not correct.
 * Fade.ahk
  - Added - A brief window when exiting an emu that runs fullscreen to attempt to prevent your front end or desktop from flashing in before your fadeOut image appears. See the new setting Fade_Out_Extra_Screen.
 * Fade animations.ahk
  - Fixed - Changes to fix statistics last time played bug
  - Fixed - Progress Bar text 1 options using incorrect variable
  - Fixed - Statistics extra line jumps bug appearing when launching a game for the first time.	
 * Statistics.ahk
  - Added - Changes to fix statistics last time played bug

  - Added - Support for Player 2 navigation keys in MultiGame, Rom Map Launch Menu, and HyperPause.
  - Added - Rom Mapping and Launch menu support for Having a list of mame clones where only your parents are show in your wheel. You would define all the clones on the rom map ini.
  - Changed - Log now shows the actual OS language rather than a language code. I had to remove 2 language code translations as it made the expression too long for ahk: (0443 = Uzbek_Latin and 0843 = Uzbek_Cyrillic), I 
  - Changed - Always logs errors

2014/04/01
 * HyperLaunch - v3.0.0.8
  - Added - Log which shows the run (CLI) command sent to BetaBrite and another when exiting HL
  - Added - Log which shows the run (CLI) command sent to CPWizard and another when exiting HL
  - Added - Log which shows the run (CLI) command sent to VJoy and another when exiting HL
  - Added - Logs to identify what method of the Main thread HyperLaunch used where it branches off depending on what SkipChecks is used.
  - Fixed - CLI for BetaBrite support on launch, removed an extra path being sent to betabrite.
  - Fixed - SkipChecks method was looking for "Rom" not "Rom Only"

2014/03/01
 * HyperLaunch - v3.0.0.7
  - Fixed - StopGlobalUserFeatures moved to FadeOutExit instead of FadeInExit. It would not trigger if emu closed w/o pressing the exit emu key. Also if fadeOut was disabled, would not trigger.
  - Fixed - IniFileEdit bug that would not correctly locate the end of line characters on all ini-type files.

2014/02/01
 * HyperLaunch - v3.0.0.6
  - Added - A new method to troubleshoot launching emus. For the most part, this eliminates the need to create batch files when you need to test running an emu directly to read the output in a command window.
  - Added - New setting to control showing the command window, Logging_Show_Command_Window. See the HL site for more info: https://sites.google.com/site/hyperlaunch2/home/first-steps/keys?pli=1#TOC-Logging-
  - Once HLHQ is updated with the new setting, you can set this in the Logging section. For now, you can only turn it on/off manually in the Settings\HyperLaunch.ini.
  - Changed - WinClose function now also does a winwaitclose with a quick timeout so it can properly return errorlevel if required in the module.
  - Added - A library I had to create to read from INI-type config files w/o any [sections] defined. I made this so I can read/write to the RetroArch cfg as it uses an assinine method to store settings. New function calls available for use include ReadProperty, WriteProperty, and SaveProperty. See how to use them in the new RetroArch module or by reading them in shared.ahk.

2014/01/01
 * HyperLaunch - v3.0.0.5
  - 7z has been completely rewritten and optimized because of a couple bugs found. This gave me the opportunity to remove a lot of duplicate code (shrunk by 50%) that I just didn't want to bother doing before, but now I had to in order to fix said bugs.
  - 7z should no longer create 3 romName folders deep if your rom is inside a folder in the archive. Yuck, I know...
  - 7z now does a size compare of the contents of an archive and what's already extracted in your temp folder. If they differ, it will extract the game again, otherwise it loads the already extracted rom.
  - 7z has had many more logs added/changed to track what's going on.
  - Keymapper will no longer error if an AHK profile is not found. It will instead give a warning in the log. This will make it so you don't have to create profiles for every game once enabled or a blank default one.
  - "Rom Extensions" is now a working choice for Skip Checks. It is used for systems like scummvm when your games are zipped and the file matches the database but roms inside do not.
  - romExtensions variable is now send on every launch even when Skip Checks is used. On some scenarios it was still needed by the module or some features.
  - Rom Mapping now logs the rom it found rather than only the files it looks for. It also logs if and how many roms it found for the map table.
  - Fade Animation's default animation logs when a sound is played.
  - Fixed bug in Rom Map Launch Menu that it would not destroy the gui when FadeIn was disabled
  - Fixed bug in Rom Map Launch Menu that it would not restore your exit emu key to control CloseProcess on its exit and would trigger ExitModule() prematurely when key was pressed.
  - MultiGame's table creation call moved so it doesn't only trigger when FadeIn is enabled

2013/12/01
 * HyperLaunch - v3.0.0.4
  - Module Extensions\HyperLaunch.dll updated to add some new functions used in the near future.
  - If Skipchecks is enabled in any way, will convert romPaths to absolute if relative
  - Added a new Setting in HL to turn on or off the 7z extracting and complete sounds on a global or per-system basis
  - Fade option "Detect Error" has had some additional functionality added. If true (default), will error if there is a problem with the module and waiting for a window to appear. If you disable this, it will not error, but the module may get stuck if something is wrong like an incompatbile error.
  - All WinWait and WinWaitActive calls in the modules will log detailed information about the currently active window before and after the command is run. This is only done when debug or higher logging level is set.
  - The log will now warn you if you have a different system name than what is supported by the module.
 * HyperPause
  - Esrb has been changed to Rating in your HyperPause Game Info Item List options (If you were using this choice, please fix this otherwise you will not see Ratings)
  - All Data\Game Info\*.ini files have been changed to reflect the above change
  - Added Earth Bound (USA) (Proto) rom info in the Data\Game Info\Nintendo Entertainment System.ini (Thanks Cruel Moose)

  - Fixed errorlevel being set and causing problems in the ePSXe module and triggering a scripterror because HL thought errorlevel was set when it shouldn't be.
  - Lib\Shared.ahk - added some screen manipulation functions and an updated togglemenu function
  - Lib\HyperPause.ahk - contains a fix for the xp bug that brolly and others were having. Also fixed some bugs reported by windowlicker11.

  - Lib\Fade Animations.ahk - updated to now search for wheel images in in Media\Wheels folder as a primary source and HyperSpin Media folders as a secondary source. Further detaching HL from HS.
  - Media\Fade\_Default\System folder can be deleted if you were using it. Use the above folder instead now.
  - Lib\Keymapper.ahk - Fixed incorrect path for AHK and JoyToKey system profiles
  - Lib\User Functions.ahk - Added StartGlobalUserFeatures() and StopGlobalUserFeatures().
  - These Functions now allow you to define code that will run globally in every module. You would use the Stop function if there is something you need to do on exit.
 * Media
  - Media\Bezels\Sega Pico - contains bezel images for the Sega Pico system
 * Keymapper
  - System JoyIDsPreferredControllers key changed to a default value of "use_global"
