#Use this file to map your 3DArcade system names to RocketLauncher official system names
#Some modules require RocketLauncher official names so it's highly recommended that you configure the maps
#format is:
#3d_arcade_system_name=rocketlauncher_system_name
#3d_arcade_system_name should be the name used on field #10 in your atf files.
#if a system has no entry in this ini, no remap will be done and the 3D Arcade system name will be used
