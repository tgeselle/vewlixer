 * General
  - All modules have been updated, changing 'MSystem :=' to 'MSystem ='
  - Run 'Rename Modules for HLv3.0.0.4.exe' to approve one-by-one a rename of all your modules to the new standard. It will automatically create a backup of your Modules folder. Be careful with Demul, Project64, & Virtual APF as they have multiple modules in the folders. I kept either the author name or the version of the emu in the filename to distinguish the differences.
  - Run 'Rename Global Emu ini for HLv3.0.0.4.exe' to approve one-by-one a rename of all your Global Emulator Module values to the new standard. It will automatically create a backup of your Global Emulators.ini before it writes to the file.
 * PicoDrive
